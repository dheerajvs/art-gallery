      Sowmya is a truly outstanding artist I have come across. I'm overwhelmed
      with the stunning Tanjore painting of Lord Vishnu that she has made for
      me. I thank her for taking the time to execute the painting with ultimate
      perfection and passion.

      As an art lover, I fall easily in love with paintings. But honestly, my
      passion to learn painting was lit up the moment I saw Sowmya's paintings.
      The brilliant colours in her paintings are simply amazing. I consider
      myself extremely fortunate to have learnt the first strokes of my brush
      under her guidance. Thank you Sowmya, you are my angel.

      Bought Toy Seller oil painting from Sowmya. The painting is beautiful! The
      Toy Seller lady in the painting looks real and alive. The color choices
      are perfect. One of the best oil paintings that I have purchased for my
      collection. She is a very talented artist. Would definitely recommend her
      work.

      expectations. We were not disappointed. Her oil painting sits proudly as a
      focal piece in our living room, the finish and delivery cannot be faulted!

      Sowmya is an incredible artist. Her attention to detail is very
      impressive. She is one of those artists who will help your imagination
      come to life. She understands your needs with patience. We got done
      tanjore paintings with antique finish done for our pooja room, a main
      panel of Lord Venkateshwara and 2 side panels each comprising of of
      goddess Lakshmi, Lord Ganesha, goddess Saraswathi and another of Lord
      Satyanarayana Swamy, Lord Shiva with goddess Parvathi and goddess Kannika
      Parameshwari. Would highly recommend her if you want to get the right art
      done.

      Sowmya is a wonderful artist. Her works are very neat and the finishing is
      very good. In all her paintings, the eyes are expressive. The best part
      about Sowmya is that she tries different kinds of art forms and she is
      very good in everything. Her latest is Tanjore paintings, which she does
      effortlessly. She is also a great teacher. I learnt zentangles, Kalamkari,
      Kerala murals and oil painting from her. I appreciate Sowmya's dedication
      to art and wish her the best in her journey.

      Exquisite, passionate and an excellent painter are few words that
      describes Sowmya and her paintings and we are extremely pleased with the
      high quality of workmanship. We own a coffee painting of Lord Krishna and
      a couple of pot paintings for our indoor garden decor and we just love
      them.
