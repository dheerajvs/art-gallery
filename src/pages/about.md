      Radha Krishna in Kalamkari style and it is just gorgeous. Her eye for

      As an art lover, I fall easily in love with paintings. But honestly, my
      passion to learn painting was lit up the moment I saw Sowmya's paintings.
      The brilliant colours in her paintings are simply amazing. I consider
      myself extremely fortunate to have learnt the first strokes of my brush
      under her guidance. Thank you Sowmya, you are my angel.

      Bought Toy Seller oil painting from Sowmya. The painting is beautiful! The
      Toy Seller lady in the painting looks real and alive. The color choices
      are perfect. One of the best oil paintings that I have purchased for my
      collection. She is a very talented artist. Would definitely recommend her
      work.

      Recommended by a family friend, we approached Sowmya with the highest of
      expectations. We were not disappointed. Her oil painting sits proudly as a
      focal piece in our living room, the finish and delivery cannot be faulted!
