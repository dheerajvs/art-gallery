      Sowmya is a very talented and dedicated artist. I have her painting of
      Radha Krishna in Kalamkari style and it is just gorgeous. Her eye for

      Sowmya is a truly outstanding artist I have come across. I'm overwhelmed
      with the stunning Tanjore painting that she had made for me. I thank her
      for taking the time to execute the painting with ultimate perfection and
      passion.

Born and brought up in Bangalore, Sowmya had always shown precocious talent in the fields of art and athletics. She forayed into fine-arts at the age of ten and has never stopped learning.

She began her professional career in the IT industry, worked at a number of startups in engineering and business development positions and also founded a software company of her own. Despite a successful career, she found her true calling as a fine-arts painter.

Sowmya's repertoire now extends from traditional oil paintings and tanjore paintings to kalamkari, murals and zentangles. She conducts workshops on kalamkari, fabric painting and zentangles. So far she has trained several hundred students.
